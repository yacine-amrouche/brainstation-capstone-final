FitCraft

## Overview

Are you tired of generic workout routines that don't align with your fitness goals and lifestyle? Introducing FitCraft, the revolutionary web app that crafts personalized workout experiences tailored just for you.

### Problem

Many fitness apps offer one-size-fits-all solutions, leaving users feeling uninspired and disconnected from their fitness journeys. FitCraft addresses this issue by creating dynamic, customized workouts that truly cater to individual goals and needs.

### User Profile

FitCraft's innovative approach starts by engaging users in a personalized onboarding process. Through a series of questions about fitness objectives, preferred exercise types, and availability, FitCraft gathers the necessary information to curate a workout plan that suits your lifestyle.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

## Implementation
